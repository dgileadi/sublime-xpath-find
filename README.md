# Sublime Text 3 plugin: XPathFind

This plugin makes two commands available:

`XPath: find matches` will prompt you to enter an XPath expression and will search the current view for xml nodes that match it.

`XPath from element at cursor` will create a simple XPath expression from the element at the cursor and will copy it to the clipboard.

## Install
